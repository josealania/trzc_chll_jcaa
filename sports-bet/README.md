Technical decisions:

1. Create the project using a typescript template.
2. I decided to use react-redux for state management.
3. I decided to use Material UI for rendering components.
4. I decided to use Scss styling.
5. I decided to use jest with enzyme for unit tests.
6. I decided to use cypress for end to end tests.
7. I also worked with hooks and axios to fetch data from api.

How to use the program(i assume you are using Visual Studio Code and the Terminal.):

1. run the following command: npm i
2. run the following command: npm run start
3. the application will load in the browser, maybe in port 3000, if this port is in use by other app you will be asked to choose another port.
4. To run unit tests run the following command : npm test
5. To run end to end tests use cypress Test runner, tests are located in folder: [project path]/cypress/integration

Business rules:

1. You can bet for all market selections as the business is to sell bets :).
